Input list: 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> 25 -> 36 -> 49 -> 64 -> 81 -> 100 -> 121 -> 144 -> 169 -> 196 -> 225 -> 256 -> 289 -> 324 -> 361
Start pos:   4
Returned list: 16 -> 64 -> 144 -> 256

Checking to make sure that all of the nodes in the output list are
from the input list.  If you see a failure reported here, then
it's likely that you did one or more of the following:
   - Created new nodes, instead of just changing the references
   - Swapped values between nodes
 ... Checking ...
ERROR: One of the nodes in the list that you returned was supposed to have been removed; it was in the original list, but was not supposed to be in the result.
Output list node check complete.
