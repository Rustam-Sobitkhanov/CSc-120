Input list: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> 13 -> 17 -> 19 -> abc -> def -> ghi -> jkl -> mno -> pqrs -> tuv -> wxyz -> foo -> bar -> baz
Start pos:   0
Returned list: 2 -> 11 -> abc -> mno -> foo

Checking to make sure that all of the nodes in the output list are
from the input list.  If you see a failure reported here, then
it's likely that you did one or more of the following:
   - Created new nodes, instead of just changing the references
   - Swapped values between nodes
 ... Checking ...
ERROR: One of the nodes in the list that you returned was supposed to have been removed; it was in the original list, but was not supposed to be in the result.
Output list node check complete.
