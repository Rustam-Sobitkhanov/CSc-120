Testing accordion_4()...

Input list: a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i -> j -> k -> l -> m -> n -> o -> p -> q -> r -> s -> t -> u -> v -> w -> x -> y -> z
Start pos:   2
Returned list: c -> g -> k -> o -> s -> w

Checking to make sure that all of the nodes in the output list are
from the input list.  If you see a failure reported here, then
it's likely that you did one or more of the following:
   - Created new nodes, instead of just changing the references
   - Swapped values between nodes
 ... Checking ...
ERROR: One of the nodes in the list that you returned was supposed to have been removed; it was in the original list, but was not supposed to be in the result.
Output list node check complete.
